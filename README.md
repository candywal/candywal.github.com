Unsure how much I'm going to change the above, will look into it later. But shower thought on how site should change: 
- better pic
- have a decent bio
- have a what i'm doing rn section
- blogs should probably be on some sort of sharing site
- maybe start making more youtube videos/streams
- stream on which platform
- make the entire page a single page
- spend time revamping (maybe around first week december)
